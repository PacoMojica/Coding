   [0](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/0_Rotate_Array.cpp). Given an unsorted array arr'[] of size N, rotate it by D elements (counter clockwise).
  
   [1](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/1_Subarray_Sum.cpp).  Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
   
   [2](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/2_Counting_Triplets.cpp). Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.

  [3](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/3_Kadane_Algorithm.cpp). Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with       maximum sum. Time Complexity O(n)
  
  [4](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/4_Merge_Spaceless.cpp). Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] in non-decreasing order with size   n and m.
  The task is to merge the two sorted arrays into one sorted array (in non-decreasing order).
  Note: Expected time complexity is O((n+m) log(n+m)). DO NOT use extra space.
  
  [5](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/5_Rearrange_Array_Alt.cpp). Given a sorted array of positive integers. Your task is to rearrange      the array elements alternatively.
    i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on...
    Note: O(1) extra space is allowed. Also, try to modify the input array as required.
  
  [6](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/6_Num_Pairs.cpp). Given two arrays X and Y of positive long integers, find number of pairs such that x^y > y^x (raised to power of)
    where x is an element from X and y is an element from Y.
   
  [7](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/7_Inversion.cpp). Given an array of positive long integers. The task is to find inversion count of array.
    Inversion Count : For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.   
    Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.
    
  [8](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/8_Sort_0s_1s_2s.cpp). Given an array A of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order.
   
  [9](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/9_Equillibrium_Point.cpp). Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position where equilibrium first occurs in the array.
    Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
   
  [10](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/10_Leaders.cpp). Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.
    Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader.
    
  [11](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/dab51bc33a6837db0a7052d5560b547d90cc6134/Arrays/11_Min_Platforms.cpp). Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
  
  [12](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/12_Rev_Ar_Grps.py). Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array of K group elements.
  
  [13](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/13_kth_smallest_element.cpp). Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array.
  
  [14](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/14_Trapping_Rain.py). Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing height of blocks at index i as Ai where the width of each block is 1. Compute how much water can be trapped in between blocks after raining.
  
  [15](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/15_Pythogorean_Triplet.py). Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a pythogorean triplet (a, b, c).
  
  [16](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/16_Choclate_dist.py). Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet.
  Each packet can have variable number of chocolates.
  There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
  1. Each student gets one packet.
  2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
  
  [17](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/17_Stock_Buy_Sell.py). The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.

  [18](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/18_Middle.py). Given an unsorted array of size N. Find the first element in array such that all of its left elements are smaller and all right elements to it are greater than it.

  [19](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/19_ZigZag.py). Given an array A (distinct elements) of size N. Rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f. The relative order of elements is same in the output i.e you have to iterate on the original array only.

  [20](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/20_Last_index_1.py). Given a string S consisting only '0's and '1's, print the last index of the '1' present in it.
  
  [21](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/21_Spiral_Traversal.cpp). Given a matrix mat[][] of size M*N. Traverse and print the matrix in spiral form.
  
  [22](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/22_Largest_Num.cpp). Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them in such a manner that they form the largest number possible. The result is going to be very large, hence return the result in the form of a string.
