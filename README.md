# Must do Interview Coding Problems from GeekforGeeks

  This repository is a collection of my solutions to the must do probelms in [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/)

### 0. To get started follow the Books or Coding Interview University

  0. [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) is the perfect place to get started with your preperation.
  
  1. [The Coding Book](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/CodingBook.pdf)
  2. [Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf)
  3. [Guide to Competitive Programming_ Learning and Improving Algorithms Through Contests](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Guide%20to%20Competitive%20Programming_%20Learning%20and%20Improving%20Algorithms%20Through%20Contests%20(%20PDFDrive.com%20).pdf)
    
  
### 1. Divide and Conquer

### 2. Recursion 

### 3. Arrays

  [0](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/0_Rotate_Array.cpp). Given an unsorted array arr'[] of size N, rotate it by D elements (counter clockwise).
  
   [1](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/1_Subarray_Sum.cpp).  Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
   
   [2](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/2_Counting_Triplets.cpp). Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.

  [3](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/3_Kadane_Algorithm.cpp). Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with       maximum sum. Time Complexity O(n)
  
  [4](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/4_Merge_Spaceless.cpp). Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] in non-decreasing order with size   n and m.
  The task is to merge the two sorted arrays into one sorted array (in non-decreasing order).
  Note: Expected time complexity is O((n+m) log(n+m)). DO NOT use extra space.
  
  [5](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Arrays/5_Rearrange_Array_Alt.cpp). Given a sorted array of positive integers. Your task is to rearrange      the array elements alternatively.
    i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on...
    Note: O(1) extra space is allowed. Also, try to modify the input array as required.
   

### 4. Strings
